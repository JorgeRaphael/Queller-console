A Java console program for the Queller bot by Quitch
Author: Pedro "Plimapeli" Lima (Fubanga on BGG)

To run the .JAR file, extract it to a folder in your computer, get to that
folder via console (cmd in Windows) and run the command:
java -jar queller.jar

Observations:
1. Only base game is available. No expansion yet.
2. Any input ('y'/'n' or Queller roll) can be inserted in lower case or
upper case so you don't have to worry if your caps lock is activated
or not. 'y' equals 'Y' and 'A H M C E P' equals 'a h m c e p'.
3. An UPPERCASE text indicates a Queller term, which you can find in page 2 of Queller's PDF.
4. An action is indicated by ">>> ACTION <<<" (less-greater than symbols)
5. Give me feedback on the topic on BGG, BGG mail (Fubanga) or
my email: ppslima@gmail.com with the subject "Queller".

Have fun!
