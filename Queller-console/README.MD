A Java console program for the Queller bot by Quitch
Author: Pedro "Plimapeli" Lima (Fubanga on BGG)
Thanks to Guilherme Toledo for the excellent feedback and Quitch for Queller. 

Queller file page:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/141333/queller-bot-war-ring-solo-play

To run the .JAR file, extract it to a folder in your computer, get to that
folder via console (cmd in Windows) and run the command:
java -jar queller.jar

Observations:
1. Only base game is available. No expansion yet.
2. Inputs are case insensitive
3. An UPPERCASE text indicates a Queller term, which you can find on page 2 of Queller's PDF.
4. An action is indicated by arrowheads ">>> ACTION <<<"
5. Give me feedback on the topic on BGG, BGG mail (Fubanga) or
my email: ppslima@gmail.com with the subject "Queller".

Have fun!
